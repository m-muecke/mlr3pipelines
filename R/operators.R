#' @title PipeOp Composition Operator
#'
#' @description
#' These operators creates a connection that "pipes" data from the source `g1` into the sink `g2`.
#' Both source and sink can either be
#' a [`Graph`] or a [`PipeOp`] (or an object that can be automatically converted into a [`Graph`] or [`PipeOp`], see [`as_graph()`] and [`as_pipeop()`]).
#'
#' `%>>%` and `%>>!%` try to automatically match output channels of `g1` to input channels of `g2`; this is only possible if either
#' * the number of output channels of `g1` (as given by `g1$output`) is equal to the
#' number of input channels of `g2` (as given by `g2$input`), or
#' * `g1` has only one output channel (i.e. `g1$output` has one line), or
#' * `g2` has only one input channel, which is a *vararg* channel (i.e. `g2$input` has one line, with `name` entry `"..."`).
#'
#' Connections between channels are created in the
#' order in which they occur in `g1` and `g2`, respectively: `g1`'s output channel 1 is connected to `g2`'s input
#' channel 1, channel 2 to 2 etc.
#'
#' `%>>%` always creates deep copies of its input arguments, so they cannot be modified by reference afterwards.
#' To access individual [`PipeOp`]s after composition, use the resulting [`Graph`]'s `$pipeops` list.
#' `%>>!%`, on the other hand, tries to avoid cloning its first argument: If it is a [`Graph`], then this [`Graph`]
#' will be modified in-place.
#'
#' When `%>>!%` fails, then it leaves `g1` in an incompletely modified state. It is therefore usually recommended to use
#' `%>>%`, since the very marginal gain of performance from
#' using `%>>!%` often does not outweigh the risk of either modifying objects by-reference that should not be modified or getting
#' graphs that are in an incompletely modified state. However,
#' when creating long [`Graph`]s, chaining with `%>>!%` instead of `%>>%` can give noticeable performance benefits
#' because `%>>%` makes a number of `clone()`-calls that is quadratic in chain length, `%>>!%` only linear.
#'
#' `concat_graphs(g1, g2, in_place = FALSE)` is equivalent to `g1 %>>% g2`. `concat_graphs(g1, g2, in_place = TRUE)` is equivalent to `g1 %>>!% g2`.
#'
#' Both arguments of `%>>%` are automatically converted to [`Graph`]s using [`as_graph()`]; this means that objects on either side may be objects
#' that can be automatically converted to [`PipeOp`]s (such as [`Learner`][mlr3::Learner]s or [`Filter`][mlr3filters::Filter]s), or that can
#' be converted to [`Graph`]s. This means, in particular, `list`s of [`Graph`]s, [`PipeOp`]s or objects convertible to that, because
#' [`as_graph()`] automatically applies [`gunion()`] to `list`s. See examples. If the first argument of `%>>!%` is not a [`Graph`], then
#' it is cloned just as when `%>>%` is used; `%>>!%` only avoids `clone()` if the first argument is a [`Graph`].
#'
#' Note that if `g1` is `NULL`, `g2` converted to a [`Graph`] will be returned.
#' Analogously, if `g2` is `NULL`, `g1` converted to a [`Graph`] will be returned.
#'
#' @param g1 ([`Graph`] | [`PipeOp`] | [`Learner`][mlr3::Learner] | [`Filter`][mlr3filters::Filter] | `list` | `...`) \cr
#'   [`Graph`] / [`PipeOp`] / object-convertible-to-[`PipeOp`] to put in front of `g2`.
#' @param g2 ([`Graph`] | [`PipeOp`] | [`Learner`][mlr3::Learner] | [`Filter`][mlr3filters::Filter] | `list` | `...`) \cr
#'   [`Graph`] / [`PipeOp`] / object-convertible-to-[`PipeOp`] to put after `g1`.
#' @param in_place (`logical(1)`)\cr
#'   Whether to try to avoid cloning `g1`. If `g1` is not a [`Graph`], then it is cloned regardless.

#' @title Chain a Series of Graphs

#' @description
#' Takes an arbitrary amount of [`Graph`]s or [`PipeOp`]s (or objects that can be automatically
#' converted into [`Graph`]s or [`PipeOp`]s, see [`as_graph()`] and [`as_pipeop()`]) as inputs and joins
#' them in a serial [`Graph`], as if connecting them using [`%>>%`].
#'
#' Care is taken to avoid unnecessarily cloning of components. A call of
#' `chain_graphs(list(g1, g2, g3, g4, ...), in_place = FALSE)` is equivalent to
#' `g1 %>>% g2 %>>!% g3 %>>!% g4 %>>!% ...`.
#' A call of `chain_graphs(list(g1, g2, g3, g4, ...), in_place = FALSE)`
#' is equivalent to `g1 %>>!% g2 %>>!% g3 %>>!% g4 %>>!% ...` (differing in the
#' first operator being `%>>!%` as well).
#'
#' @param graphs `list` of ([`Graph`] | [`PipeOp`] | `NULL` | `...`)\cr
#'   List of elements which are the
#'   [`Graph`]s to be joined. Elements must be convertible to [`Graph`] or [`PipeOp`] using [`as_graph()`] and [`as_pipeop()`].

#' @param in_place (`logical(1)`)\cr

#'   of [`%>>!%`] over [`%>>%`]. This can only be avoided if `graphs[[1]]` is already a [`Graph`].

#'   modified state when `in_place` is `TRUE`.
